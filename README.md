# Contributing to the Knapsack

## What you need

  In order to work and contribute to Knapsack, you need a copy of [Eclipse](eclipse.org), a [Java virtual machine](java.com), a copy of the Knapsack API, and a [GitHub](github.com)account.

## What to do

### Repairing 'leaks'

  One of the most important parts of working with Knapsack (or any bag) is to make sure it can do what you need it to. We use Github's built in issue system to work out and fix these issues. If you find an issue you would like to fix, just create a pull request, and begin working. Please provide a list of files you altered, and any major things you did. 

  If your submission is benefiting the project it will be submitted.
